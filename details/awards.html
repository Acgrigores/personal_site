            <p>To win the award, a student must go through several stages which include qualification, performance and submitting accomplishments.

To advance, they must submit a list of accomplishments, including a high school transcript, a personal essay and a letter of recommendation. Finally, 7,600 students nationwide are chosen as National Merit award winners. Winners receive a $2,500 scholarship along with academic recognition.</p>
