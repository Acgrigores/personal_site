            <p>"Due to their hard work, dedication and progress this year, the students... have earned the National Cyber Scholarship Foundation (NCSF) Scholar with Honors status for 2023. This means they have qualified as a National Cyber Scholar based on their performance in the CyberStart gamified learning platform, and gone on to complete the 2023 Cyber Foundations Academy, completing the SANS Foundations course and earning the industry-recognized GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT) certification.</p>
