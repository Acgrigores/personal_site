            <img src="../src/cc.png" alt="Calling Card">
            <p>As part of my internship at Google, I end-to-end engineered a feature for Android's Calling Card.</p>
            <p>My work involved creating a Material Color Utilities API allowing developers to find contrasting text
                to an image to support accessibility goals, and using the API to develop contrasting colors for Calling Card's setup, including
                intdoducing a "smart color" that contrasted the image while matching its hue. The feature is used by .3 billion active daily users,
                and the phone app handles 7 billion daily phone calls.

            <img src="../src/photostrip.png" alt="Photo Strip">
            <p>For UIUC's Engineering Open House, I created an AI photobooth that took photos of visitors, analyzed their emotions
                , and generated backgrounds that matched its interpretation of their emotions. Our booth attracted over 300
                 visitors over two days, who used the experience to learn about the benefits and limitations of artificial
                  intelligence when it comes to interpretation and creativity. 
                  I also loved the opportunity to get kids excited about AI and to teach them that computers and creativity 
                  can go hand in hand. I also set up a program to automatically save and email the strips to  visitors,
                   so that they'd have a little souvenir to take home from the fair.</p>
