            <p>As part of my internship at Google, I end-to-end engineered a feature for Android's Calling Card.</p>
            <p>My work involved creating a Material Color Utilities API allowing developers to find contrasting text
                to an image to support accessibility goals, and using the API to develop contrasting colors for Calling Card's setup, including
                intdoducing a "smart color" that contrasted the image while matching its hue. The feature is used by .3 billion active daily users,
                and the phone app handles 7 billion daily phone calls.

            <p>For UIUC's Engineering Open House, I created an AI photobooth that took photos of visitors, analyzed their emotions
                , and generated backgrounds that matched its interpretation of their emotions. Our booth attracted over 300
                 visitors over two days, who used the experience to learn about the benefits and limitations of artificial
                  intelligence when it comes to interpretation and creativity. 
                  I also loved the opportunity to get kids excited about AI and to teach them that computers and creativity 
                  can go hand in hand. I also set up a program to automatically save and email the strips to  visitors,
                 so that they'd have a little souvenir to take home from the fair.</p>

            <p>This was a group project. My role was organizing the team, coming up with the challenge ideas, programming 7 of the challenges,
                 programming the introduction page and map, setting up the UI, handling input validation, and initializing the site with the necessary Flask
                  frameworks and testing documents. I also collaborated with others to review code changes, and respond to feedback on my own changes.</p>

            <p>This project was made in a team of 3 at a 12-hour hackathon. We made a website for a nonprofit organization assisting veterans that allowed veterans and volunteers to sign 
                up for events to benefit their mental health. The program included automatically sending the signup information to a 
                spreadsheet that generated buttons to automatically mass email participants of a given event. We ended up winning
                 first place in the hackathon.</p>

            <h1>Crop Counter for Brazilian Nonprofit</h1>
            <b>Python, various LLM APIs, Google Sheets scripts</b>
            <img src="../src/beans.png" alt="truck full of castor beans">
            <p>As a UIUC Grainger Career Scholar, I worked in a group of four to research the viability of using AI to count crops.</p>
            <p> This was part of a partnership with Toca, a Brazilian nonprofit organization that supports family farming. Many family farmers never learn basic math, reading, or technology skills, which makes them reliant on others to calculate the amount of castor beans that they've produced. </p>
            <p> My group of 4 researched different AI tools and methods to determine the easiest and most accurate way to calculate the mass of a pile of beans (like the one in the image), and presented our findings and analysis to the organization.</p>
            <p>Challenges:</p>
            <p>Finding an AI model that could recognize and count so many items; especially since the beans are natural shapes rather than all looking the same, it was difficult for models to recognize them. We addressed this by expanding our search for models, as well as by taking different approaches such as estimating the area a pile took up and using that for our calculations.</p>
            <p>Getting an estimate for the actual weight of the beans,; the nonprofit didn't have any weight estimates, and the weight of castor beans varies based on factors that we couldn't access, such as humidity. We addressed this by creating a tool that allowed the nonprofit to weigh one batch of beans and input the result, which then generated statistics on the accuracy of each of our solutions.</p>

            <p>This was for my internship at Loyola Chicago. I made the frontend of a site to which users can upload their computer
                 vision models to test how they run on a cluster of low-powered machines. This was for research I was doing at Loyola
                  University Chicago's software and systems laboratory. I was also involved with setting up the machine cluster.</p>

            <p>I completed various projects for my intro CS course.</p>
            <p>To learn about dynamic memory, I made an elementary database system with functionality to add, remove, and print tables, rows, and columns.</p>
            <p>I also made an application to analyze a DNA sample (stored as a linked list) and determine who it belongs to.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I made an application for content-aware image resizing using the seam carving method.  I worked with dynamic memory, 2D arrays, and learned to optimize the algorithm to find the ideal way to cut the image.</p>

            <p>I completed various projects for my Data Structures course.</p>
            <p>I made a sticker application to explore image processing in C++, use the HSL color space, and explore memory management.</p>
            <p>I wrote a template List class to learn to manipulate linked memory by writing functions to modify linked lists, practice using templates, and get familiar with iterators.</p>
            <p>I made a program that constructs images out of other images to learn about k-d trees, implement and use a nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithm, and practice using templates and const-correctness.</p>
            <p>I made a program to efficiently traverse and fill in an image based on the original image's colors.</p>
            <p>I made a maze generator and solver to implement the disjoint sets data structure.</p>
            <p>I also made a tile puzzle program, practicing working with a graph that is to large too store completely in memory, using graph algorithms, and implementing algorithms from public sources documents.</p>

            <p>I also made a TED talk generator based on Disney songs, that used Markov chains to generate its own speech. I also experimented with how the model could be poisoned with false data.</p>
