            <img src="../src/luc.png" alt="Loyola Research">
            <p>I was a research intern at Loyola University Chicago the summers after my sophomore and senior years of high school. Accomplishments:</p>
            <p>I developed a Flask web application allowing researchers to evaluate and optimize the efficiency of their computer vision models on a cluster of low-powered devices, facilitating resource-constrained AI development for the eventual goal of running artificial intelligence on phones.</p>
            <p>I contributed to a published research paper on the security risks of popular machine learning model hubs such as HuggingFace, bringing awareness to the risks of open-source artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>I evaluated and presented a comparative analysis of leading Python charting libraries, assessing ease of use and visual appeal to guide optimal tool selection for scientific data visualization, which led to changes in the lab's charting methods for their research papers.</p>
